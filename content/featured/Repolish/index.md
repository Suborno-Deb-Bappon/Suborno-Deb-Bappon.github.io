Created an AI-driven tool that automates the generation of README.md files for GitHub repos using CrewAI agents and OpenAI LLMs.

- Parses repo content and generates professional documentation with architecture summaries and usage instructions.
- YAML-driven modular pipeline supports markdown cleanup, PR automation, and structured review.
- Integrated with GitHub for automated PR deployment of generated docs.
