Engineered a CrewAI-based system that orchestrates role-specific agents like engineering leads and UI designers to autonomously convert plain-text software requirements into structured Python modules and UI prototypes.

- Designed modular task pipelines and YAML-configurable agents supporting Gemini 2.5 Flash for LLM reasoning.
- Auto-generated software architecture (class diagrams + code) from inferred requirements.
- Enabled full backend + UI prototyping via Gradio with one-click ZIP exports for MVP testing.
