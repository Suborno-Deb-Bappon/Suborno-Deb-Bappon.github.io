Hello! I'm Suborno Deb Bappon, currently living in Saskatoon — the Land of Living Skies in Canada.

I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Saskatchewan (2023–2025), with research interests spanning artificial intelligence, software engineering, and data science. I work on developing intelligent systems, analyzing large-scale datasets, and designing tools that solve real-world problems. My work includes transformer-based code analysis, multi-agent AI systems, and data-driven dashboards.

I’ve also served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and Research Assistant, and was previously a Lecturer at Eastern University. I enjoy mentoring others, collaborating on research, and contributing to open-source projects.

Here are a few things I enjoy beyond work and research — helping others grow, solving complex problems, leading with purpose, and learning new technologies every day!
